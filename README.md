# Classification-Problem-using-Log-Reg-Decision-Tree-Random-Forest
Created a model for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure.
STEPS:
1. Import libraries
2. Import dataset
3. Check for null values
4. Exploratory Data Analysis-(EDA)
5. Model Building

Steps in Model Building
1. Seperate x and y cols
2. Import libraries required for preprocessing and building model
3. Split data into training and testing data (Done only once)
4. Fitting & training data.  (Logistic Regression model)
5. Checking the predictions.
6. Seeing recall score for both train and test data.
7. We notice an Overfitting Model.
8. Improving recall score by using (Decision Tree & Random Forest) models, checking metrics (recall score again).
8. Finally using the best model which has highest recall score.
